# PHP-data-access-methods-code-generator
This Repo contains a code generator written in PHP. Developers need not waste time writing methods for retrieving data, inserting data, updating data, submitting forms etc as this code generates all that code automatically. To use this, specify a database table (at the minimum) and run the script to generate code for methods that can be used to manipulate data in the table.
